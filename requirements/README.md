### 2. Test Asset Management
- Hierarchical organization of test cases and test suites
- Reusable test components and shared steps
- Test case templates and standardization
- Tags and categories for easy filtering
- Links between related test cases
- Support for attachments and test data

### 3. Static Site Generation
